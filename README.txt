Trip on the Funny Boat
----------------------

This game was made for the second PyWeek competition during the week from
25.3.2006 to 2.4.2006. All source code and data was created from scratch by the
project team during this time, apart from the font and the collision detection
library used in the game (detailed below in "License").

You play the role of a steamboat captain on the wild seas populated by sharks,
pirates, minefields and the occasional seagull.

Game modes:
-----------

Story mode: In the story mode, you will go through five different phases of
play, and then face the final boss in the sixth phase. The story mode starts
easy, but you should find it quite challenging in the last phases.

Endless mode: Endless mode will put you up against waves after waves of enemies,
with twelve different phases. Endless mode is very challenging, but it's the
only way to get the big high scores. :-)

Power ups:
----------

There are little health power ups that give you one heart back if you have lost
them while battling enemies. You have a total of five hearts and if you lose all
of them, you will die, so be sure to take all the power ups that come your way.

Enemies:
--------

Shark: The sharks jump out of the water, so you'll have to time your shooting
carefully.

Mine: The mines won't try any tricks on you, but make sure that you're on a high
wave or jumping when it comes your way.

Pirate ship: These bastards shoot you with their cannons. You'll have to shoot
them back twice before they sink. Touching them doesn't hurt you so you might be
able to sail through them if you watch their cannon fire carefully.
